## Current State of the App
Pre-Beta: the app is able to pull player names, but it's not yet able to pull 3 Point FG %.

## Future Improvements
- Actually be able to pull the 3 point percentage.
- Simulate a 3 Point Contest, have graphics that show how many shots were made.
- Have the game run multiple times.
